This is a simple cli gcm standards encryption and decryption tool.
To use it simply git clone this repo.
cd in the repo.
go build.
go install.
If you have your go path set you are good to go, else do this first ->
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin:/usr/local/go/bin
This will set your gopath and you can run the installed tool globally.
if you want it to be permanent write these in your .bashrc/.zshrc/.profile.
